function [Vertices] = AdjustBorders(Vertices, BorderVal)
% this function detects vertices moving from one boundary to the other,
% changing the Vertex boundary accordingly.
% BorderVal is an array containing the minimum and maximum values of the
% geometry along the three axes:
% BorderVal(1)= minimun on x.
% BorderVal(2)= maximum on x.
% BorderVal(3)= minimun on y axis. etc...
% eps - a certain distance in which the vertex is manually moved to the boundary

% !!!FOR SOME REASON THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK ALONG WITH ReflctBoundaryMesh!!!
